The magnetic permeability, B, is the ability of the material to conduct the magnetic flux.
$$
B = \mu H
$$
where
$$
H = \frac{Ni}{L_c}
$$

While we can assume the permeability to be constant for some situations like in air, it's not a constant for ferromagnetic materials.

We can see the relationship between the magnetomotive force ($\Im$) and the total magnetic flux ($\phi$) by graphing it.

- The region that climbs up quickly is the unsaturated region,
- the region that is a plateau is the saturated region,
- the region between the saturated and unsaturated regions is the transition region (aka the knee).

We can see that the relationship between B vs. H is the same as $\phi$ vs. $\Im$.
