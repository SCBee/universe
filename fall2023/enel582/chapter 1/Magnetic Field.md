Magnetic fields are the principle phenomenon that allows motors, generators, and transformers to operate.

1. A current carrying wire produces a magnetic field around it
2. A time-changing magnetic field induces a voltage in a coil of wire if it passing through that coil
3. A current carrying wire in the presence of a magnetic field has a force induced on it
4. A moving wire in the presence of a magnetic field has a voltage induced in it

2 is the basis of transformers
3 is the basis of motors
4 is the basis of generators
