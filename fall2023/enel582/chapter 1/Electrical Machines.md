Electrical machines, like motors and generators, convert energy from one form to another.

Most electrical machines convert energy using a magnetic field. Another type of electrical machine is the transformer which converts the AC electrical energy from one voltage level to another voltage level.

- Motors convert electrical energy to mechanical energy.
- Generators convert mechanical energy to electrical energy.
- Transformers convert AC electrical energy at one voltage level to AC electrical energy at another voltage level.

Motors can be run as generators and generators can be run as motors depending on the direction of the magnetic field.
