Ampere's Law governs the production of a magnetic field by a current.
![[ampere's law.png]]

H is the magnetic field intensity produced by the current I and dl is a differential element of length along the path of integration.

Since the direction of integration is one line, then we can simplify equation 1-18 to 

$$
H L_c = N i
$$
where H is magnetic field intensity (Ampere-turns per meter), $L_c$ is the mean path length of the core, and $I_{net}$ became $Ni$ because there is $i$ current over $N$ turns around the core.

The magnetic flux density relationship is
$$
B = \mu H
$$
where $\mu$ is the magnetic permeability of the material.

$\mu$ is usually denoted as a ratio and in terms of the permeability of free space
$$
\begin{aligned}
&\mu_0 = 4\pi \times 10^{-7} \\
&\mu_r = \frac{\mu}{\mu_0}
\end{aligned}
$$
$$
\phi = B A
$$
Using all the equations so far, the total magnetic flux in the core, $\phi$, due to current $i$ is
$$
\phi = BA = \frac{\mu NiA}{L_c}
$$
where A is the cross-sectional area that the flux is in the normal direction of.
