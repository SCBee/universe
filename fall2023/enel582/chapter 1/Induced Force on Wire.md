A current-carrying wire in the presence of a magnetic field will have an induced force acting on it.

![[induced force on wire.png]]

As shown by the figure, the wire will have a force acting perpendicular to both the direction of the wire and the magnetic field.

The force is calculated as
$$
\vec{F} = i(\vec{L} \times \vec{B})
$$
where
- i is the current
- L is the length of the wire in the direction of the current flow
- B is the magnetic flux density vector
