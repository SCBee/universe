Similar to Faraday's law, a voltage is induced on a wire if the wire is moving through the magnetic field.

The equation is
$$
e_{ind} = (v \times B) \cdot L
$$
where
- v is velocity vector
- B is magnetic flux density vector
- L is length of wire vector (needs a direction for orientation)

[[Ampere's Law|Magnetic Flux Density, B]].

This induced voltage on a moving wire through a magnetic field is called the generator action because it is fundamental to the operation of all generators.
