Ideal transformers are lossless devices meaning that there are no energy losses.

The core is made of many laminated steel sheets that decrease the amount of eddy current.

$$
\frac{V_{p}(t)}{V_{s}(t)} = \frac{N_{p}}{N_{s}} = a
$$
$$
\frac{i_{p}(t)}{i_{s}(t)} = \frac{N_{s}}{N_{p}} = \frac{1}{a}
$$

where $a$ is the turns ratio

The voltages and currents can be converted to phasor form which would keep the same ratio relationship.

#### Real Power

$$
P_{in} = V_{p}I_{p}\cos(\theta_{p}) = V_{s}I_{s}(\cos\theta_{s}) = P_{out}
$$
#### Reactive power
$$
Q_{in} = V_{p}I_{p}\sin(\theta) = V_{s}I_{s}\sin(\theta) = Q_{out}
$$

#### Apparent Power
$$
S_{in} = V_{p}I_{p} = V_{s}I_{s} = S_{out}
$$

#### Impedance Transformation through a Transformer

The impedance is a circuit's resistance to a current. The impedance of the load (secondary circuit) can be felt by the primary circuit and can be represented.

#### Load impedance [Secondary Circuit]

$$
Z_{L} = \frac{V_{s}}{I_{s}}
$$

#### Load impedance [Primary Circuit]
$$
Z_{L}^{\prime} = \frac{V_{p}}{I_{p}}
$$

Since the relationships of the voltages and currents are

$$
V_{p} = aV_{s}
$$
$$
I_{p} = \frac{I_{s}}{a}
$$
then

$$
Z_{L}^{\prime} = \frac{a^{2}V_{s}}{I_{s}}
$$
