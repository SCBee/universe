- Jean's Advice/Opinions:
	- I'll be more valuable to smaller companies that don't need just software (that needs mechanical experience)
	- believes that my software engineering internships are more important than the degree saying "mechanical and mechatronics"
	- Maybe I can drop the "mechanical" part of my degree in the resume?
	- Contact Andreas Campan since he is trying to transition from software engineering to something more electrical
