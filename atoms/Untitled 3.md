During my internship at Paramount, I spearheaded a project that involved creating a quantitative finance tool to optimize blending operations, which resulted in a significant increase in profits. This initiative was born from a casual conversation with an oil trader in my office, which sparked my interest in finding a solution to streamline the manual process of blending for profit maximization.

I dedicated the first 6 weeks to intensive research, exploring nonlinear programming and its applications in blend optimization, drawing insights from case studies and academic papers. Although the concept wasn't entirely novel in the industry, I tailored the solution specifically to Paramount's unique operational requirements. Initially developing a minimum viable product (MVP) in Python, I quickly realized the need for a more robust solution. Over the next 8 months, I crafted a durable tool in C++, overcoming limitations I encountered with Python libraries by referencing an existing Fortran implementation.

Working closely with an experienced trader provided me with a deep understanding of the operational intricacies. My role was to translate this operational knowledge, supported by updates from the production team, into a software tool that could handle the complex variables of blend operations. The software calculated the optimal volumes of various oil sources to blend, producing up to five distinct products, each meeting specific contractual requirements for characteristics and pricing. This tool directly impacted the bottom line by providing precise blending strategies that maximized profit margins, demonstrating an increase of $1.8 million USD per month in realized profits.
