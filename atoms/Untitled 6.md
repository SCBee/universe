- Situation: At Paramount, I engaged in a project aimed at optimizing blending operations to maximize profits. An oil trader shared the challenges of manual blend optimization, sparking my interest in developing a software solution.
- Task: My goal was to create a quantitative finance tool tailored to Paramount's specific needs, capable of automating the blend optimization process to increase profitability.
- Action: After six weeks of research into nonlinear programming and its applications, I developed a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) using Python. I encountered limitations with available libraries, leading me to reference a Fortran-built library for necessary features. Subsequently, I spent eight months engineering a robust solution in C++, ensuring it was customized for Paramount's operations. I incorporated ZeroMQ for its low-latency messaging capabilities to efficiently manage data streams from our facilities and the market.
- Result: The C++ tool I developed increased profits by $1.8 million USD monthly and significantly reduced manual effort. My collaborative efforts with the production and trading teams were crucial in fine-tuning the tool to align with real-world requirements and operational insights.
