1. What has drawn you into Software Development? How did you get started down that road and why?

- Software development drew me in because of the wide breadth of problems that I could solve, and how prevalent it is in our society. Also, I am always amazed at how quickly technology evolves and how software development is the driving force of so much innovation in eve
- I was introduced to programming in high school through an elective, and it was a fun class that taught me how to think through problems creatively and methodically. Through my teacher's mentorship, I began working on my personal projects and enjoying the wins (and also the struggles).
- Through my experiences, I have learned that software development is where I want to build a career because of the satisfaction I get when I solve a problem or finally fixing a bug that I couldn't figure out for days.
