Software development drew me in because of the wide breadth of problems that I could solve, and how prevalent it is in our society. Also, I am always amazed at how quickly technology evolves and how software development is the driving force of so much innovation in our daily lives.

I was introduced to programming in high school through an elective, and it was a fun class that taught me how to think through problems creatively and methodically. Through my teacher's mentorship, I began working on my personal projects and enjoying the wins (and also the struggles).

Through my experiences, I have learned that software development is where I want to build a career because of the satisfaction I get when I solve a problem or finally fixing a bug that I couldn't figure out for days.


2. What is your opinion of TDD in business software?

I view TDD as a critical part of modern software development, especially in large-scale business applications. It provides several benefits that improves both the product and the development process.

Third, it pushes the developers and architects to thoroughly design their solution before implementation leading to better architecture and modularity.

For a business with long-lasting products, I believe that TDD is essential for long-term success because it leads to an improved product, faster development cycles, reduced debugging time, and more satisfied users.
