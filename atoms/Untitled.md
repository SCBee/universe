1. What has drawn you into Software Development? How did you get started down that road and why?

Software development drew me in because of the wide breadth of problems that I could solve, and how prevalent it is in our society. Also, I am always amazed at how quickly technology evolves and how software development is the driving force of so much innovation in our daily lives.

I was introduced to programming in high school through an elective, and it was a fun class that taught me how to think through problems creatively and methodically. Through my teacher's mentorship, I began working on my personal projects and enjoying the wins (and also the struggles).

Through my experiences, I have learned that software development is where I want to build a career because of the satisfaction I get when I solve a problem or finally fixing a bug that I couldn't figure out for days.

Test-Driven Development (TDD) is a crucial aspect of modern software development, especially in the context of business applications. In my opinion, TDD offers several significant benefits.

First and foremost, TDD provides a safety net for code changes. Writing tests before the actual code ensures that any modifications won't break existing functionality. This results in more maintainable and robust software over time. Additionally, TDD encourages developers to think deeply about the design of their code upfront, fostering better architecture and modularity.

From a business perspective, TDD can lead to faster development cycles and reduced debugging time. While there's an initial investment in writing tests, the overall development process becomes more efficient as it progresses. This can contribute to delivering high-quality software within shorter time frames.

Overall, I view TDD as a valuable practice that not only improves code quality but also contributes to the long-term success of business software projects
