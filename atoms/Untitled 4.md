ZeroMQ (low latency messaging protocol):
Implemented ZeroMQ for low-latency messaging to provide pub-sub communication for facility and market data streams, chosen for its efficiency in data transmission size, reliability and fault tolerance.

**Multithreading and Concurrency**
HFT systems need to handle multiple tasks concurrently to achieve low-latency processing.

C++ provides robust support for multithreading, enabling developers to parallelize tasks effectively.
