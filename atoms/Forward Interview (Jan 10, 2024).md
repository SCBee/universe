HR Lady: Chelsea Lopez

interviewer: Natalie Fahey

Forward mission: -> highest quality hc for free

foundings in 2017:
- we believe incentives matter
- hc in us is not aligned

- forward wants to be proactive in their healthcare -> care about clients

- don't rely on humans to deliver healthcare
	- humans don't scale enough to provide enough care (not enough doctors, nurses)

- vertically integrated (build hardware in-house AND software)
	- 

- always had physical component
	- mobile app + physical clinics (2 dozen throughout US)
	- further built mobile app
		- then built physical hardware more (carepod)

- some parts of healthcare needs to be in person
	- weight, blood, etc.
