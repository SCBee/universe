HR Lady: Chelsea Lopez

interviewer: Natalie Fahey

role: full stack software engineer

Forward mission: -> highest quality hc for free

foundings in 2017:
- we believe incentives matter
- hc in us is not aligned

- forward wants to be proactive in their healthcare -> care about clients

- don't rely on humans to deliver healthcare
	- humans don't scale enough to provide enough care (not enough doctors, nurses)

- vertically integrated (build hardware in-house AND software)
	- 

- always had physical component
	- mobile app + physical clinics (2 dozen throughout US)
	- further built mobile app
		- then built physical hardware more (carepod)

- some parts of healthcare needs to be in person
	- weight, blood, etc.

- 2 weeks cadence (pods -> mix of engg/design/operations)

- generalist approach
	- applying to full stack but can't guarantee team/project/product I work on

- 1 hour technical screen is next
	- contacted by chelsea within the next 48 hours
	- coding exercise

- Natalie started at Forward 2.5 years ago
- worked as consultant
- likes that Forward works on projects that help people 

- weekly staff meeting -> doctor shares success stories
