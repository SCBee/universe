The most impactful project I recently worked on was at Paramount, where I developed a quantitative finance tool that significantly optimized our blending operations. This project began casually when I learned about the manual and inefficient blending methods one of our traders was using. Recognizing the potential for automation and improved profitability, I delved into research on nonlinear programming and its applications in blend operations optimization.

Over a period of 11 months, I developed a tailored solution that started as a Python-based MVP and evolved into a robust C++ application. This tool was specifically designed for our company's unique operational context. It took into account the intricate requirements of blend operations, including mechanical, chemical, and petrochemical aspects, which I could integrate thanks to the ongoing support of our product team and the invaluable insights from the trading team with deep knowledge of our operations.

My contribution was end-to-end: from the initial idea sparked by a conversation through to the research phase, and then the actual coding of the tool. By calculating the optimal mixtures of various oil sources, the tool I created enabled us to meet specific product characteristics for different contracts while maximizing profitability. It led to an increase in realized profits by $1.8 million USD per month, showcasing not just a significant return on investment but also the power of specialized software solutions in driving business outcomes.
