Focus on night operations
- Locating something with IR (body heat)
- Use different cameras?

Medardo likes the idea of working on night operations.

General
- For financing, email ZS a BOM as we try to build it

Mechanical
- Definitely focus on getting a frame out that works so we can rapidly iterate if needed
- Do the extra stuff AFTER
- For the props, go bigger for more lift but lower rpm
	- motors are going to based on the weight
	- battery will be based on the motors
 - For the props, go bigger than we think since if they are too small, they will have really bad
 - 1045 props (10" props) goes well with 920 kV

Electrical
- We can get a loan camera from LMT
- For the time being, use a cheap rPi camera for testing
- ZS needs to talk to Matt at his office
	- Matt is the equipment manager at their office
- They have a bin of batteries and maybe we can borrow their batteries?

Software
- Got software from LMT and Luis has installed it
- License is good for 2 installs/individuals

Testing grounds
- Chinook Winds (Park in Airdrie)
- Sheperd in the south (landfill?)
