#team-meeting

Agenda:
- Go over project scope with Dr. Hinman and Dr. Bisheban to figure out if they would like to be our faculty advisor(s) throughout the capstone.


ME:
- Both are worried that our scope is too large and we won't have enough time if we don't limit our scope.
- Ask the course coordinator if we are allowed to have two mentors for the same sub-team so that they can share the workload.
- Going down the aerodynamics route is going to be a massive time sink. Dr. Hinman suggests that we go for "good enough to fly" rather than having the "optimal design for flying".
- Dr. Hinman gave the option that if we do go down the CFD route, that he can provide us with his codebase to use with OpenFOAM for aerodynamic / CFD analyses.
- Dr. Hinman said that the best CFD simulation software are:
	- Ansys Fluent
	- Siemens CFD
	- OpenFOAM
	- OpenVSP (easy, quick but simplified outputs)
- Dr. Hinman focuses more on the aerodynamics / simulations.
- Dr. Bisheban focuses more on drone design / controls.


EE & SWE:
- Discuss with Electrical and Software sub-teams how they would be sharing tasks since there is a large overlap in the embedded systems.
- Anhela and Frank expressed interest in working on these tasks.
