- Battery choice:
	- Frank asked: How to determine what discharge rate we need?
	- Medardo said he'd get us a copy of the battery, try it out and see how it performs
	- He can also give us the batteries they use for extended flights
	- ZS said they do endurance tests to see how long it runs

- PDB / PM
	- HolyBro PM03D PM

- GPS
	- Kit comes with a GPS module

- Radio
	- ZS can lend us a radio (not the expensive one but one of their cheaper one)
	- Radio guy is Matt

- Camera
	- High resolution isn't necessary for the software to work

- Autopilot
	- Autopilot module is generally interchangeable

- Software map, they can import DTED assets
	- Can show longitude/latitude/elevation
- Map Box might be something we can use for the maps

- ZS said we can mess around with the kit
- we can buy parts to replace parts from the kit

- Business Case: Using more economic parts to keep the cap cost low, allowing communities with fewer resources to also build the design
