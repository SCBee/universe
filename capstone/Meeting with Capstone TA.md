- Will Nelson is our TA
- He isn't sure what he's doing as a TA yet

- Will is going to be part of the two design reviews
	- Recommends that we should schedule the first design review soon (In mid October)
		- Need to book a room
	- Attendance:
		- Course Coordinator
		- Zach Sims
		- TA
		- Maybe our faculty advisors?
- Presentations are not treated sequentially, they are treated as standalone. So we can't assume they already know details covered in previous meetings/presentations.
- Main thing being marked is communication.
	- General outline is
		- 15 minutes on content
		- 15 minutes on Q&A

- Interactions with Will
	- Keep meetings to 10-15 minutes
	- Treat him as another evaluator (marker)
	- Can be treated as a knowledge base as well (mechanical)

- Get design should definitely be done in first half
- Prototyping / iterating is going to be a lengthy process

- PM/Team roles are within the team, and he won't really mark that.

- Take advantage of the manufacturing knowledge from the makerspace people
###### Most important thing is SCOPE!
- Highly recommends that we have a SMALL scope.
	- The smaller scope is best.
