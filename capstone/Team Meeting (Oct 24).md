##### Mechanical
- Get a couple foam sheets from Home Depot and start playing with the material
- Spend some time into buying OTS quad + fixed wing to modify
- OpenVSP is the deepest we'll go into CFD
##### Electrical
- Scope still seems big
- Finalize between optimizing for night OR adverse situations
- Change battery size
	- Maybe increase battery from current plans to accommodate higher power requirements
- Night Ops
	- Lights -> increases power usage
		- Can't add a crazy amount of LED lights
	- Lidar -> Garmin from Adafruit costs $60 but has range up to 10m
		- Software response rate caused by fixed wing velocity 
			- Assume slow down to 60 km/h = 16.6667 m/s
			- Software will need to respond within 0.6s
- Heat
	- Fan -> cool components but increases power usage
	- Slits -> Add holes to front and back of fuselage for air flow (decrease aerodynamics but it's already a brick so not the biggest deal)
	- Painting -> Add reflective coating/shielding to frame body (weight)
##### Software
- Luis got VCSi documentation + software package on morning of Oct 24
- Unsure if the single license is good for 2 individuals or if Adam needs a separate one
	- Have to wait and see if Adam will get an email for his own copy
	- Ask ZS on Thursday (Oct 26) if Adam does not receive an email by then
