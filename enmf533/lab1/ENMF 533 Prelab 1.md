1. What programming language is used by Arduino?  

- C/C++.
- The Arduino's memory limitations make it more practical to develop using C, but the Arduino is able to use C++ specific language features like classes.



2. Explain the purpose of the void setup() command.  

- Initialise the states on the various Arduino features like pins and serial communication.
- The setup function is executed once per Arduino reset and at the beginning.



3. Explain the purpose of the void loop() command.

- Execute logic that we want to perform continuously throughout the Arduino's operation.



4. What symbol is used to compare two values (and returns TRUE if they are equal)?

- The equality operator is `==`, which will return true if both operands are equal.



5. What are the two types of input and output pins on an Arduino board?  

- Digital and Analog.



6. What are two ways that you can add a library to the Arduino IDE?

- Library Manager through "Manage Libraries" menu option.
- Download library as a zip file and "Add .ZIP library" menu option.



7. List the 9 data types that can be defined in an Arduino program.

- boolean
- char
- byte
- int
- unsigned int
- long
- unsigned long
- float
- double



8. Explain the operation of the DigitalWrite command.

- Takes two arguments: (pin, value)
- pin is the number associated with the pin we want to manage
- value is the state of the pin, and can have a value of HIGH or LOW.
	- the effect of the value depends on if the pin we are managing is an INPUT or OUTPUT pin.

- pin is OUTPUT:
	- the function changes the voltage state with the corresponding pin number.
	- HIGH means the pin will have a voltage of 5V or 3.3V.
	- LOW means the pin will have a voltage of 0V.

- pin is INPUT:
	- the function changes the corresponding pin's internal pull-up resistor.
	- HIGH means the pullup is enabled.
	- LOW means the pullup is disabled.



This job stands out as my top choice for several reasons. Firstly, it perfectly aligns with my academic background in Mechanical Engineering and my professional experience in software development, particularly my proficiency in C++ and my contributions to complex projects during my internships at Paramount and Tesla (Kingsman). The opportunity to apply my software engineering skills at  allow me to bring my expertise into the thrilling world of flight simulation, marrying my technical abilities with my interest in aeronautics, as I've demonstrated in my current capstone project with Lockheed Martin for an autonomous drone.

Moreover, the dual aspect of the role appeals to my nature as an ambitious programmer with a keen interest in aircraft systems. Having led projects from conception to completion, I understand the importance of customer relations and project rigor, all of which are part of my professional DNA. I am particularly excited about the prospect of contributing to the development of simulators for the newest aircraft platforms and driving innovative technical solutions in a field I am passionate about. My ability to solve complex problems creatively, combined with my readiness to learn and collaborate in a team, makes this opportunity with your esteemed company my top choice.

This job is my top choice because it aligns perfectly with both my passion and my experience. With a mechanical engineering background from the University of Calgary, I've honed my software development skills, particularly in C++ and Python, through internships that impacted bottom lines and operational efficiencies at Paramount and Tesla (Kingsman). This role at your client's firm would allow me to bring that expertise into the thrilling world of flight simulation, marrying my technical abilities with my interest in aeronautics, as I've demonstrated in my current capstone project with Lockheed Martin for an autonomous drone.

Moreover, my intern experiences have prepared me to lead projects from conception to completion, while my bilingual proficiency supports the client-facing and travel aspects of the role. The prospect of tackling complex problems and innovating in the field of aircraft systems is genuinely exciting to me, and I am eager to contribute to a company that has pioneered so many advancements in simulation technology.
