1. What programming language is used by Arduino?  

- C/C++.
- The Arduino's memory limitations make it more practical to develop using C, but the Arduino is able to use C++ specific language features like classes.



2. Explain the purpose of the void setup() command.  

- Initialise the states on the various Arduino features like pins and serial communication.
- The setup function is executed once per Arduino reset and at the beginning.



3. Explain the purpose of the void loop() command.

- Execute logic that we want to perform continuously throughout the Arduino's operation.



4. What symbol is used to compare two values (and returns TRUE if they are equal)?

- The equality operator is `==`, which will return true if both operands are equal.



5. What are the two types of input and output pins on an Arduino board?  

- Digital and Analog.



6. What are two ways that you can add a library to the Arduino IDE?

- Library Manager through "Manage Libraries" menu option.
- Download library as a zip file and "Add .ZIP library" menu option.



1. List the 9 data types that can be defined in an Arduino program.

- boolean
- char
- byte
- int
- unsigned int
- long
- unsigned long
- 

1. Explain the operation of the DigitalWrite command.
