1. What programming language is used by Arduino?  

- C/C++.
- The Arduino's memory limitations make it more practical to develop using C, but the Arduino is able to use C++ specific language features like classes.

2. Explain the purpose of the void setup() command.  

- Initialise the states on the various Arduino features like pins and serial communication.
- The setup function is executed once per Arduino reset and at the beginning.

3. Explain the purpose of the void loop() command.

- Execute logic that we want to perform continuously throughout the Arduino's operation.

4. What symbol is used to compare two values (and returns TRUE if they are equal)?

- The equality operator is `==`, which will return true if both 

1. What are the two types of input and output pins on an Arduino board?  
2. What are two ways that you can add a library to the Arduino IDE?  
3. List the 9 data types that can be defined in an Arduino program.  
4. Explain the operation of the DigitalWrite command.
