###### Problem
![[induced force on wire.png]]

The magnetic flux density, B, is 0.25 T directed into the page. The wire is 1 m long and has a current of 0.5 A.

What are the magnitude and direction of the force induced on the wire?

###### My Solution
The equation is
$$
F = i(L \times B)
$$
where
$$
i = 0.5 A
$$
$$
L = [0,-1,0]
$$
$$
B = [0,0,-0.25]
$$
then
$$
(L \times B) = 0.25\vec{i}
$$
$$
F = (0.5)(0.25\vec{i}) = 0.125\vec{i}\;\;N
$$
