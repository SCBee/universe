###### Problem

![[example 1-9.png]]

- velocity is 10 m/s to the right
- magnetic flux density is 0.5 T out of the page
- wire is 1 m long oriented as shown in the figure

###### My Solution
$$
v = [10, 0, 0]
$$
$$
B = [0,0,0.5]
$$
$$
L = [sin(30), cos(30), 0]
$$

$$
e_{ind} = (v \times B) \cdot L
$$
$$
(v \times B) = [0, -5, 0]
$$
$$
e_{ind} = [0, -5, 0] \cdot [sin(30), cos(30), 0] = (-4.33 \hat{j})\;V
$$
So the positive end is in the negative y direction, and the negative end is in the positive y direction.
