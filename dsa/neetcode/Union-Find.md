#dsa #graphs #unions 

The data structure is called disjoint-set and union-find is the algorithm.

Given a list of the nodes' relationships
- The idea of it is that we can find the "roots" of each node.
- We can combine the nodes by making the roots point to the root of another node

We want to use a map since we are mapping relationships from one node to another node
