>[!tip] Problem
>Write a function canConstruct(string, vector\<string>) that takes in a target string and a vector of strings.
>
>Return a boolean indicating whether it is possible to generate the target string using the vector of strings acting as a wordbank.
>
>Assume that the elements can be used infinite number of times.

examples:
	`canConstruct("abcdef", {"ab", "abc", "cd", "def", "abcd"}) -> true`
	`canConstruct("skateboard", {"bo", "rd", "ate", "t", "ska", "sk", "boar"}) -> false`
