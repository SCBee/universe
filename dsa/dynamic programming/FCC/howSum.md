>[!tip] Problem
>Write a function howSum(int, vector) that takes in a targetSum and an array of integers.
>
>Return an array that add up to the targetSum using numbers from the array.
>
>Assume that the elements can be used infinite number of times and all numbers are positive.


Example:
	`howSum(7, {5,3,4,7}) -> {3,4} or {7}`

Example:
	`howSum(8, {2,3,5}) -> {2,2,2,2} or {3,5}`

Example:
	`howSum(7, {2,4}) -> null`

Example:
	`howSum(0, {1,2,3}) -> {}`
